# Find on Reddit â€“ Chrome extension

Simple Chrome extension that finds existing Reddit posts for the pages you're browsing. Useful if you want to see if there's any discussion about the page or article.

There are two places to use the extension: 

- Click the browser menu button to search for the current page/URL
- Right click on a link on any page

If the link has already been posted to Reddit you'll see the list of posts, or if it's only been posted once it'll load that directly. If the post isn't on Reddit you'll see the link submission page (default Reddit behaviour).
